# ADR 0001: Abuse-Resistant Access to Gemini via Middleware + Internal Proxy

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-07

## Context

Previously, the client could call our image generation endpoint directly. This exposed us to:

- Cross-site request abuse (CSRF-style or off-origin calls).
- Accidental key exposure if client-to-server plumbing wasnâ€™t carefully isolated.
- Lack of strict input guardrails on public-facing endpoints.

We needed a way to make browser access safer without introducing a full auth system.

## Decision

Introduce a SameSite/HttpOnly session cookie via middleware and route all browser-originated generation calls through a constrained proxy. The actual generation endpoint only accepts requests from the proxy using a server-only header.

## Changes

- `middleware.ts`
  - Sets a minimal `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie (`cg_session`) for same-site, non-API requests.
  - Skips API routes and Next internal assets to avoid unnecessary work or cache fragmentation.

- `app/api/gemini/proxy/route.ts` (public entrypoint)
  - Enforces same-origin using `Origin`/`Referer` vs request URL origin.
  - Requires the `cg_session` cookie set by middleware.
  - Requires `Content-Type: application/json`.
  - Forwards to the internal `generate` endpoint with a server-only `x-internal-auth` header; disables caching.

- `app/api/gemini/generate/route.ts` (internal-only)
  - Rejects any request missing/invalid `x-internal-auth`.

## Consequences

- Public endpoint is significantly harder to script from other sites (SameSite=Strict + origin checks).
- The internal generation route is not callable by the browser directly.
- Slight additional hop (proxy) adds minimal latency, but improves safety.
- Frontend should call `/api/gemini/proxy` instead of `/api/gemini/generate`.

## Follow-ups

- Replace hardcoded internal secret with an environment variable and rotation policy.
- Add rate limiting, body size limits, and input validation (prompt length, image count) on the proxy.
- Ensure all client code uses the proxy path consistently.
